# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

## Overview

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a deep learning project that involves the recognition and classification of handwritten digits into numbers between 0 and 9. This project is built upon a deep learning model trained on the `MNIST` dataset, a widely used dataset for digit recognition tasks. Additionally, a simple user interface has been implemented using the `Pygame` module to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Technolgies/Modules used
* `Keras`: Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python. It is widely used for building and training deep learning models due to its simplicity and flexibility.
* `Pygame`: Pygame is a popular cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. In this project, Pygame is used to create a graphical user interface for interacting with the digit recognition model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the digit recognition model is the `MNIST` dataset. MNIST is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, ranging from 0 to 9. It is a benchmark dataset for machine learning and computer vision tasks, making it an ideal choice for this project.
